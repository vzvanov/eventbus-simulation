# EventBus Simulation

The "Event Bus" pattern was simulated. There are two categories of objects: "Event Sources" and "Event
Subscribers" that communicate through the "Event Bus". There are four types of events: 
"set_red" - paints the background of subscribers in red;
"set_yellow", "set_green", "set_none": events that color subscribers' backgrounds yellow, green, and uncolor respectively.
Subscribers subscribe to events randomly. Subscribing to the "set_none" event is required.
